# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program


The purpose of this project was to implement a PID controller to control the steering and throttle of a car driving in a simulator. The implementation was quite short and straightforward. The proportional (P) component brings the car back to center, with steering being stronger the further the car is from the center. Alone it causes substantial oscillation that increases quickly and drives the car off the track. The difference (D) components is proportional to the change in consecutive values of distance from the center and it dampens the oscillation, as it decreases steering the higher changes in position are. The integral (I) component removes systematic bias in steering.


With low throttle, it was relatively easy to find parameter values that work and allow the car to drive around the lake track staying on the track. The car oscillates constantly and I could not get rid of that, although including the I and D components was sufficient to keep the car on track. With higher throttle (higher velocities), staying on the track was more difficult. 


I also implemented the Twiddle parameter optimization to tune the PID hyperparameters. I implemented an automatic restart of the simulator after 2200 frames or if the car gets stuck. The user can leave the car racing and optimizing its own parameters with the twiddle trial and error method, where successful parameter change proposals that decrease total error are kept. 


I implemented another class Twiddle.cpp and made a change in the CMakelist.txt. I hope this works in the grader...  


My observations were: 1) Twiddle has to have relatively good initial estimates for the parameter values and their scales. With completely arbitrary values and scales I did not observe much convergence, at least with limited amount of iterations (as each lap takes several minutes). With good initial estimates, the algorithm is able to improve the parameters. On a track with obstacles to get stuck on, this seems to a be multi-modal parameter optimization problem with lots of local optima to get stuck to. The optimal parameters depend on the throttle value or throttle model (if controlled by another PID). An example of parameter values that I got by Twiddle and which work for constant throttle=0.5, are Kp=0.5, Ki=0.01, Kd=10. 


I tried manually a few configurations to control the speed with another PID control, but did not reach any conclusion beyond the obvious that racing is easy with low velocities and difficult with high velocities. I did not try Twiddle here.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
